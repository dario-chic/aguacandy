## Description

This project is a **Landing Page** designed for a local candy store, **Aguacandy**. It features a beautiful, simple, and minimalist design, focusing on showcasing the store's products and services in an elegant and user-friendly way. While the website doesn't have many complex functionalities, it stands out for its **custom responsive slider**, which I developed from scratch to adapt seamlessly to different devices.

_üí°This project holds a special place in my journey as a developer. It was my first experience with  **Next.js**, and it taught me valuable lessons about responsive design, animations, and problem-solving. Looking back, I see areas for improvement, but it was a crucial step in shaping my skills as a frontend developer._

## Main Features


### Responsive Slider

The  **Responsive Slider**  is the standout feature of this project. It was a challenging yet rewarding problem to solve. My goal was to create two different views for different devices:

-   A  **slider**  for mobile devices.
    
-   A  **standard grid**  for larger screens where the slider wasn't necessary.
    

After experimenting with various approaches, I developed a prototype that worked but lacked smooth transitions. By combining  **class switching**  and  **CSS animations**, I achieved a much smoother and more polished result.
